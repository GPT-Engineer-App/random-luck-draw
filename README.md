# random-luck-draw

A lottery drawing website. It should accept a list of users and their odds of winning as one input, and the number of winners as another input. The website will then perform a random drawing based on these inputs to determine the winners, saving the results along with timestamps in a database. The results page should display the list of winning users and their respective odds.
